Battle for the Bridge was designed and developed by Matt Jones as his senior capstone 
for the Digital Worlds Institute.

Special Thanks to Nick Heitzman, who always motivated and instructed me into taking 
this project further and further.

And thank you to the class of 2020, whose brilliance always inspired me. I hope I see
you all out there again.
